Idea 1)  **Traffic signal automation:**

Problem : Most of the time we wait at the signal even when there are no cars going. 
Or sometimes there are very few cars who need to cross and rest of the time the just stays green/red for no one.


Description: The software will dynamically change the signal based on real time traffic analysis. 
This will save a lot of time of the people traveling by car.



Idea 2) **Adaptive Programming challenges recommendation**

Problem: Predict the time taken to solve a problem given the current status of the user.

Description: Given the data of programmers and questions that they have previously solved, along with the time that they took to solve that particular question. 
As a data scientist, the model you build will help online judges to decide the next level of questions to recommend to a user. 


Idea 3)  **Email/chat application using Blockchain**

Problem: Recently Facebook data got hacked and mostly of the data could be leaked.
Here to prevent data leakage we will use blockchain for communication between the peers.

Description: Using blockchain we can store the data in distributed ledger to avoid data hacks. A decentralised blockchain network will be created 
where data will be accessible to the receiver whom sender has given the authorization.
